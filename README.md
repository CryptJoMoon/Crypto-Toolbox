Our token will be soon accepted as payment for crypto based tools that we have developed. Some are release now and others will be released soon.

You can also trade the token just like any other waves token. It does not have to be redeemed for software services. The purchase of the tokens helps fund our development of current and future crypto related tools.

We will have a lightpaper and website finished soon. We also will explore the options of other exchanges when the opportunity is right.

This project is being ran by @CryptJoMoon and is being manned solo. For now there will not be any additional admins in this group. So please understand that you may not get immediate answers. I do not want to bring in untrained admins that know nothing about the project and spread false info like I have seen in other projects. Also keep in mind that I am the developer of all the crypto tools and have to work on them as well. So please be patient. I will not be revealing my identity and will just be know as CryptJoMoon, if you cannot accept this then do not buy our token.
